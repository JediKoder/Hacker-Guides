SIFT Workstation Overview

An international team of forensics experts, led by SANS Faculty Fellow Rob Lee, created the SANS Incident Forensic Toolkit (SIFT) Workstation for incident response and digital forensics use and made it available to the whole community as a public service. The free SIFT toolkit, that can match any modern incident response and forensic tool suite, is also featured in SANS' Advanced Incident Response course (FOR 508). It demonstrates that advanced investigations and responding to intrusions can be accomplished using cutting-edge open-source tools that are freely available and frequently updated.

Tails OS

Tails is a live operating system that you can start on almost any computer from a DVD, USB stick, or SD card.

It aims at preserving your privacy and anonymity, and helps you to:

use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship;
all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor network;
leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly;
use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging.

OWASP Security Shepherd

The OWASP Security Shepherd Project is a web and mobile application security training platform. Security Shepherd has been designed to foster and improve security awareness among a varied skill-set demographic. The aim of this project is to take AppSec novices or experienced engineers and sharpen their penetration testing skill set to security expert status.

CAINE (Computer Aided INvestigative Environment) offers a complete forensic environment that is organized to integrate existing software tools as software modules and to provide a friendly graphical interface.
The main design objectives that CAINE aims to guarantee are the following:
an interoperable environment that supports the digital investigator during the four phases of the digital investigation
a user-friendly graphical interface and user-friendly tools.

WEAKERTHAN Linux 6
WEAKERTH4N Linux 6 is the latest version of the penetration testing environment that I have built using Debian Linux. All previous versions of Weakerthan, including WEAKERTH4N, have been geared toward those who prefer the command line interface for all of their hacking. This version, however, I have included GUI tools to try for a wider audience. It is still built using Debian Linux (And the BETA is using the stock kernel), still uses Fluxbox as the window manager, and still comes packed with all of the custom code that I have written over the years including WARCARRIER.

DEFT Association
On September 2012, the DEFT Linux project turned into a non-profit association, called “DEFT Association”, with the following mandate:
Designing and developing the Gnu Linux distribution called DEFT (acronym for Digital Evidence & Forensics Toolkit) and some of the applications included in the system;
Distributing the DEFT system free of charge and through any available technological means;
Producing and distributing the documentation to guide responsible use of the system and all its applications;
Creating a National and International reference point for the organisation and coordination of events, training & ICT  courses, conferences and meetings on the subject of Digital Forensics through the use of open source systems.
Anyone can join the DEFT Association and become a regular member, provided that he/she:
Operates within the Digital Forensics field as an enthusiast, consultant or works with Law Enforcement Agencies;
Shows interest in the subjects included in the social purpose of the Association;
Is willing to dedicate an annual number of hours towards the betterment of  projects undertaken by the DEFT Association.
The membership can be obtained by issuing a formal application to the DEFT Council, pointing out any possible position held in other Organisations with a similar purpose. The application will be accepted on a discretionary basis subject to the verification of the requirements of the applicant and without prejudice to the decision.
Approval of registration will be followed by the addition of the new member to the DEFT association member list. The member will have to provide personal data which will be treated according to Art. 13-24 and following of the Italian D.Lgs no. 196/2003.
Here follows the unabridged version of the DEFT Association Statute, it’s in Italian because the Association was founded in Italy under the Italian law and regulations.

Kioptrix VM Image Challenges:
This Kioptrix VM Image are easy challenges. The object of the game is to acquire
root access via any means possible (except actually hacking the VM server or player).
The purpose of these games are to learn the basic tools and techniques in vulnerability
assessment and exploitation. There are more ways then one to successfully complete the challenges.

LAMPSecurity training is designed to be a series of vulnerable virtual machine images along with complementary documentation designed to teach linux,apache,php,mysql security.


OWASP Mutillidae II is a free, open source, deliberately vulnerable web-application providing a target for web-security enthusiest. Mutillidae can be installed on Linux and Windows using LAMP, WAMP, and XAMMP. It is pre-installed on SamuraiWTF and OWASP BWA. The existing version can be updated on these platforms. With dozens of vulns and hints to help the user; this is an easy-to-use web hacking environment designed for labs, security enthusiast, classrooms, CTF, and vulnerability assessment tool targets. Mutillidae has been used in graduate security courses, corporate web sec training courses, and as an "assess the assessor" target for vulnerability assessment software.

Other Tricks

Add a ~ to any .php you see.
Also add # to any .php you see; example wp-config.php# (for all the emacs users that somehow are still alive)
Add .bak or .old after any .php you see (Or replace .php with them) - may still get preprocessed though. e.g. index.php --> index.php.old, index.bak etc.
Try .phps for php source, alternate naming convention
Some places still use test.domain.tld for testing new configurations before deploying, may have different access controls that allow you to see directory listings, etc
